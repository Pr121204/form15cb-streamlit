}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACCURACY:

1. MULTILINGUAL CONTEXT:
   This invoice may be in English, Portuguese, German, French, Spanish, Italian, and other languages.
   Common invoice terms in other languages:
   - Portuguese: "Fatura" (Invoice), "Data" (Date), "Moeda" (Currency), "Valor" (Amount), "Sede/Morada" (Address)
   - German: "Rechnung" (Invoice), "Datum" (Date), "Adresse" (Address), "Betrag" (Amount)
   - French: "Facture" (Invoice), "Date" (Date), "Adresse" (Address), "Montant" (Amount)
   - Spanish: "Factura" (Invoice), "Fecha" (Date), "Dirección" (Address), "Importe" (Amount)

2. ADDRESS EXTRACTION (THIS IS CRITICAL):
   - Extract the FULL complete address for both remitter and beneficiary
   - Include: Street address, Building/House number, City/Town, Postal/Zip code, Country
   - Do NOT abbreviate street names, cities, or districts
   - If address spans multiple lines, combine them into one complete address
   - Pay attention to all address components visible on invoice
   - For Portugal: Include districts like "Lisboa", "Porto", etc.
   - For Germany: Include the ZIP code if available (format: DE-12345)

3. REMITTER vs BENEFICIARY IDENTIFICATION:
   - REMITTER = entity issuing the invoice (appears in letterhead/top)
   - BENEFICIARY = entity being invoiced (to-party/bill-to address on invoice)
   - remitter_country should be where the issuer is based
   - beneficiary_country should be where the customer/buyer is based

4. COUNTRY EXTRACTION:
   - Extract country name from addresses (not as assumption)
   - Common countries: Germany (DE), Portugal (PT), Spain (ES), France (FR), Italy (IT), Netherlands (NL), Poland (PL), Brazil (BR), USA (US), etc.
   - Look for country codes like "DE-", "FR-", "ES-", "IT-" in postal codes or explicitly stated
   - Return FULL country name (e.g., "Germany" not "DE")
   - Do NOT infer country from email domains or addresses containing only an email; rely on physical location text such as street, postal code, VAT ID, or country name.

5. BENEFICIARY NAME EXTRACTION RULES (VISUAL PDF INPUT):
   - You are reading the full PDF visually. Use ALL visual elements — header, footer, letterhead,
     logo area, and any registration or small-print legal blocks.
   - The beneficiary is the FOREIGN company who issued this invoice / is being paid (the seller/exporter),
     not the Indian remitter.
   - Look specifically in these locations to identify the beneficiary name:
     (a) Top-left or top-center: usually the company logo + brand + name.
     (b) Bottom footer: registration line such as
         "Expleo Technology Germany GmbH • HRB 98200 • ...".
     (c) Any block that contains HRB/HRA (German court registration), VAT ID (e.g. "DE..."),
         IBAN, or BIC/SWIFT codes — the full legal company name is almost always very close
         to these identifiers.
   - Legal suffixes to look for when deciding on the final beneficiary name include:
     GmbH, LLC, Ltd, PLC, AG, SA, BV, NV, SRL, AB, Corp, Inc, SAS, KG, SARL, Oy, AS.
   - NEVER return an email address or domain (like "EXPLEOGROUP.COM") as the beneficiary name.
     If you see an email or domain near the logo or footer, treat it as a clue and look nearby
     for the actual company name with a legal suffix, and return that company name instead.
   - If the top of the invoice shows only a logo/brand name without a legal suffix (for example
     "{ expleo }"), scan the footer and registration blocks for the full legal entity name
     (for example "Expleo Technology Germany GmbH") and return that full legal name.

6. EUROPEAN NUMBER FORMAT:
   - Some invoices use European format: comma for decimal (65,00 = 65.00), period for thousands (1.234,56 = 1234.56)
   - Should return normalized: "65.00" not "65,00"
   - Always extract NET TOTAL, not line items

7. INVOICE DATES:
   - Look for "Invoice Date", "Date", "Datum", "Data", "Fecha"
   - Return in DD/MM/YYYY format
   - Common formats you might see: DD/MM/YYYY, DD.MM.YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD

8. AMOUNT AND CURRENCY:
   - Extract TOTAL invoice amount (not line items)
   - Remove all currency symbols and formatting
   - Return pure number: "1245.67" (not "1.245,67 EUR")
   - Currency: Look for symbols (€, £, $, ¥) or 3-letter codes (EUR, GBP, USD, JPY)

Return ONLY valid JSON with no additional text or markdown formatting."""

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. MULTILINGUAL CONTEXT:
   This invoice may contain text in a mix of English and local languages. We receive invoices from
   approximately 60 countries from these regions:
   - Europe: Portugal, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, 
     Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Finland
   - Asia: Japan, China, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia
   - Americas: Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile
   - Middle East: UAE, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey
   - Others: Australia, South Africa, Canada, New Zealand
   
   Key multilingual invoice terms you may encounter:
   - "Fatura"/"Factura" (PT/ES) = Invoice
   - "Rechnung" (DE) = Invoice
   - "Facture" (FR) = Invoice
   - "Fattura" (IT) = Invoice
   - "Sede" (PT/ES) = Headquarters/Office Address
   - "NIPC"/"NIF" (PT) = Portuguese Tax ID
   - "Capital social" (PT/ES) = Share Capital
   - "ATCUD" (PT) = Portuguese Invoice Authentication Code (NOT invoice number)
   - "Doc No." / "Nr." / "N°" / "Nº" / "Número" = Invoice Number
   - "Doc Date" / "Datum" / "Data" = Invoice Date

2. EUROPEAN NUMBER FORMAT:
   Some invoices use European number format where:
   - Comma (,) is the DECIMAL separator: "65,00" means EUR 65.00 (not €65,000)
   - Period (.) is the THOUSANDS separator: "1.000" means one thousand
   - When you see "65,000" in a EUROPEAN invoice, it means 65.000 (sixty-five, not sixty-five thousand)
   
   CRITICAL: Always extract the NET TOTAL invoice amount (not line items).
   Look for keywords: "Net", "Total", "Invoice amount", "Amount due", "Total due", "Montant"
   Return the final invoice total as a pure number (e.g., "65.00" not "65,00").

3. PORTUGAL-SPECIFIC FIELDS:
   ATCUD (Portuguese Invoice Authentication Code) is a government-generated code like "JFXFDRRY-2881728917".
   - ATCUD is NOT the invoice number.
   - The invoice number appears separately after "Doc No." or "Número de Documento".
   - Never extract ATCUD as the invoice_number.

4. INVOICE NUMBER EXTRACTION:
   The invoice_number must come from explicit labels such as:
   - "Invoice No", "Invoice Number", "Invoice #", "Inv No", "Reference Number", "Ref No", "Nº", "Número".
   - Do NOT extract: ATCUD codes, PO numbers, order IDs, or authentication codes.
   - For Portuguese invoices, skip "ATCUD" and look for "Doc No." or similar.

5. CRITICAL RULE: INDIAN OUTWARD REMITTANCE ROLE ASSIGNMENT
   ⚠️ THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE FOR THIS FORM ⚠️
   
   This form is for INDIAN COMPANIES making outward remittance payments to foreign beneficiaries.
   
   THUS:
   - remitter_name MUST BE an INDIAN entity (the company paying/sending money)
   - beneficiary_name MUST BE a FOREIGN entity (the company receiving/being paid)
   
   HOW TO IDENTIFY:
   - Look for the address that contains "INDIA" or Indian city names: 
     Mumbai, Bangalore, Bengaluru, New Delhi, Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Pune, 
     Chandigarh, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Agra, Indore, Surat, Nashik, Vadodara, Nagpur
   → This entity (with INDIA address) is ALWAYS the remitter
   
   - The other entity (with non-Indian address like Portugal, Germany, USA, etc.)
   → This is ALWAYS the beneficiary
   
   DO NOT assume the entity appearing in the invoice letterhead (top) is either the remitter or 
   beneficiary. IDENTIFY BASED ON ADDRESS LOCATION:
   - Indian address → remitter (they are paying)
   - Foreign address → beneficiary (they are being paid)
   
   SPECIAL NOTE ON LAYOUT:
   Foreign supplier invoices often have the supplier's details at the top (letterhead).
   The buyer's (Indian company's) details often appear lower on the invoice (bill-to section).
   DO NOT let letter head position confuse role assignment. ALWAYS assign by address location.
   
6. BEST EFFORT:

   - For nature_of_remittance, purpose_group, purpose_code: return your best matching suggestion even if 
     not 100% certain. Always return something unless the invoice gives absolutely no clue.
    - Prefer returning a close match over returning empty.
